      <h2>Restoring our Ocean.</h2>
      <p>REDUCE YOUR CARBON FOOTPRINT:-
        The climate crisis threatens the health of our oceans and the marine wildlife that call them home. Sea levels
        are rising, and we are experiencing more extreme weather globally, and carbon dioxide – a known greenhouse gas –
        is making our oceans more acidic.

      <p>1. RIGHTS-BASED FISHERY MANAGEMENT
        Traditional fishery management structures encourage anglers to catch as much as possible in the shortest amount of time. 
        2. REGULATING FISHING METHODS
        It’s possible to make fishing more sustainable by regulating the methods used to catch fish.
        3. TRACABILITY STANDARDS
        Around 4,500,000 fishing vessels are spread out around the world, shipping product internationally. Depending on how much a nation relies on importing seafood, quality control will vary.
        4. MARINE PROTECTED AREAS
        Declaring certain waters protected and tightly regulating — or outright halting — fishing in those waters is scientifically proven to be one of the most effective overfishing solutions.

      <p>Shop Wisely. Choose sustainable seafood. Buy less plastic and bring a reusable bag.
        Reduce Vehicle Pollution. Use fuel efficient vehicles, carpool or ride a bike.
        Use Less Energy. Choose energy efficient light bulbs and don't overset your thermostat.

      <p>Classical biological control, or biocontrol, is the use of living organisms such as insects, mites or fungal pathogens to control pest populations. It levels the playing-field by reintroducing some of the specialist natural enemies that help control the invasive species in its native range.

      <p>YOU CAN HELP STOP OCEAN ACIDIFICATION
        We can stop ocean acidification by cutting carbon pollution drastically and immediately. We are exerting a massive influence in the oceans with unpredictable and potentially catastrophic consequences if we continue to pollute.
