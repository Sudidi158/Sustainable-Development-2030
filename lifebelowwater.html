        <h2>ABOUT MARINE LIFE</h2>
      <p>Most life forms evolved initially in marine habitats. By volume, oceans provide about 90% of the living space on the planet. The earliest vertebrates appeared in the form of fish, which live exclusively in water. Some of these evolved into amphibians, which spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. One group of amphibians evolved into reptiles and mammals and a few subsets of each returned to the ocean as sea snakes, sea turtles, seals, manatees, and whales. Plant forms such as kelp and other algae grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. Plankton forms the general foundation of the ocean food chain, particularly phytoplankton which are key primary producers.

        <h2>CORAL REEF</h2>
          <p>A coral reef is an underwater ecosystem characterized by reef-building corals. Reefs are formed of colonies of coral polyps held together by calcium carbonate. Most coral reefs are built from stony corals, whose polyps cluster in groups.

            Coral belongs to the class Anthozoa in the animal phylum Cnidaria, which includes sea anemones and jellyfish. Unlike sea anemones, corals secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons that support and protect the coral. Most reefs grow best in warm, shallow, clear, sunny and agitated water. Coral reefs first appeared 485 million years ago, at the dawn of the Early Ordovician, displacing the microbial and sponge reefs of the Cambrian.

          <h2>MORE ABOUT MARINE ECOSYSTEM</h2>
            <p>Marine ecosystems are the largest of Earth's aquatic ecosystems and exist in waters that have a high salt content. These systems contrast with freshwater ecosystems, which have a lower salt content. Marine ecosystems are home to a wide variety of life forms, including fish, sharks, turtles, jellyfish, corals, and many other organisms.

          <h2>THE BEAUTY OF THE WORLD UNDERWATER</h2>
            <p>The beauty of underwater marine life is not just for our enjoyment; it is crucial to the health of our planet. Oceans are a primary source of oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide, and regulate climate. Healthy marine ecosystems also help protect coastal areas from erosion and extreme weather events.

          <h2>WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF MARINE ECOSYSTEM?</h2>
            <p>At a fundamental level, marine life affects the nature of the planet. Marine organisms, mostly microorganisms, produce oxygen and sequester carbon. Marine life, in part, shape and protect shorelines, and some marine organisms even help create new land (e.g. coral building reefs).

          <h2>HOW ARE WE HUMANS AFFECTING THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT?</h2>
            <p>Human activities affect marine life and marine habitats through overfishing, habitat loss, the introduction of invasive species, ocean pollution, ocean acidification and ocean warming.

          <h2>1:- OVERFISHING</h2>
            <p>Overfishing often goes hand in hand with wasteful types of commercial fishing that haul in massive amounts of unwanted fish or other animals, which are then discarded. Overfishing is a major cause of marine life extinction. Here is the latetest report on overfishing: In 2023, U.S. fisheries data revealed that 94% of stocks are not subject to overfishing and 82% are not overfished. These numbers show slight improvements compared to the 2022 figures of 93% and 81%, respectively.

          <h2>2:- HABITAT LOSS</h2>
            <p>Marine habitat loss or destruction is where the marine environment or a particular ecosystem degrades to a point where it is unable to support the animal and plant life that would usually reside there. Here is the latest report on habitat loss: Among marine habitats, an estimated 30-50 percent of vulnerable marine habitats have been lost, with patterns of loss accelerating in recent decades.

          <h2>3:- INTRODUCTION OF INVASIVE SPECIES.</h2>
            <p>An invasive species is an introduced, nonnative organism (disease, parasite, plant, or animal) that begins to spread or expand its range from the site of its original introduction and that has the potential to cause harm to the environment, the economy, or to human health. Here is the latest report on invasive species: In the last decade, the number of invasive species has increased by more than 50 percent. This is due to the introduction of new species, such as fish, mammals, and birds, which are not native to the area.

          <h2>4:- OCEAN POLLUTION</h2>
            <p>All marine debris comes from people with a majority of it originating on land and entering the ocean and Great Lakes through littering, poor waste management practices, storm water discharge, and extreme natural events such as tsunamis and hurricanes. Here is the latest report on ocean pollution: A recent study by CSIRO and the University of Toronto, as reported by Science X, has found that around 11 million metric tons of plastic waste reside on the ocean floor.

          <h2>5:- OCEAN ACIDIFICATION.</h2>
            <p>Ocean acidification refers to a reduction in the pH of the ocean over an extended period of time, caused primarily by uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Here is the latest report on ocean acidification: Ocean acidification has increased rapidly causing pH to drop by approximately 30% since the pre-industrial era. Further decreases in pH are projected in the future. Seawater pH has decreased from 8.11 in 1985 to 8.05 in 2021.

          <h2>6:- OCEAN WARMING.</h2>
            <p>Heat stored in the ocean causes its water to expand, which is responsible for one-third to one-half of global sea level rise. Most of the added energy is stored at the surface, at a depth of zero to 700 meters. Here is the latest report on ocean warming: Ocean heat content reached its highest level in 2023, according to a consolidated analysis of data. Warming rates show a particularly strong increase in the past two decades. It is expected that warming will continue â€“ a change which is irreversible on scales of hundreds to thousands of years.
